// syntax, and performance for standard use cases.  This means that
// some tradeoffs were made for less common use cases.
//
// In particular, findPointId() may take a long time when called with
// ids that do not exist in the route because of the behind-the-scenes
// caching.  If this is an important use case and you are ABSOLUTELY
// sure that the points list has not been modified since the class was
// created from a message, you can avoid this performance hit by
