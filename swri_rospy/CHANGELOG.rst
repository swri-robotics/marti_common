0.0.11 (2016-05-13)
-------------------

0.0.10 (2016-05-12)
-------------------
* Adds swri_rospy subclasses for Subscriber, Service, and Timer
  These classes are drop-in replacements for their rospy counterparts,
  except that their constructor has an additional parameter
  asynchronous, which defaults to False. If asynchronous is false, the
  callback is wrapped with the single_threaded decorator. (This means
  that all of these classes use the single-thread callback queue by
  default.)
  Also, swri_rospy.spin is now injected into the rospy namespace to
  override rospy.spin. This is done to prevent users from accidentally
  using rospy.spin, which does not process the callback queue.
* Adds deadlock protection to single_threaded decorator.
  Decorating a function with single_threaded more than once would cause the
  callback queue to deadlock. This prevents recursive decoration.
* Adds exception handling to single_threaded decorator.
* Makes single_threaded decorator work for arbitrary ags
* Adds service_wrapper decorator.
  Also fixes line endings.
* Updates swri_rospy single_threaded example.
  Also fixes line-endings.
* Creates a new package swri_rospy.
  swri_rospy adds a new callback-based subscription, timer, and service
  capability to rospy.
* Contributors: Ed Venator, Edward Venator
